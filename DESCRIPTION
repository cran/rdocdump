Description: Dump source code, documentation and vignettes of an 'R'
    package into a single file. Supports installed packages, tar.gz
    archives, and package source directories. If the package is not
    installed, only its source is automatically downloaded from CRAN for
    processing. The output is a single plain text file or a character
    vector, which is useful to ingest complete package documentation and
    source into a large language model (LLM) or pass it further to other
    tools, such as 'ragnar' <https://github.com/tidyverse/ragnar> to
    create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.
